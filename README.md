## Business Activities 

* **What specific financial problem is the company trying to solve?** 

    Apollo was designed to offer every mainstream cryptocurrency feature on one untraceable platform. Also one of their main goals is to provide users with a cryptocurrency thatthey can buy and sell with complete assurance of privacy. Cryptocurrency is also inaccessible to the majority of the world as it requires a bank account, computer, and knowledge. So they are looking into creating a physical currency like a bill or coin that is tied to the blockchain. Then they will have physical locations where anyone can walk in and purchase Apollo with cash.

* **Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**

    They cryptocurrency is intended for the governments as a currency which will have a effect on everybody. They are currently working in Africa and have made a historic partnership with the African Development Funding Group (ADF Group) which works with 54 African Nations at the presidential and ministerial level to provide funding and sustainable development on a range of commercial and non-profit ventures.   
    
    Quote from the CEO of the ADF Group : "It is for this reason that we have identified Apollo Currency Africa as the only and obvious choice with regard to cryptocurrency and its application in an African perspective, to form and integrate into our involvement in the African continent." 

* **What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?**

    They offer all features that each cryto has and combine it into one. Below is a comparison chart of the top crytocurrencys in the market today and you will be to see how much more Apollo has to offer. 

* **Which technologies are they currrently using, and how are they implementing them?**

    A couple of the technologies that they are using include:

    **Olympus Protocol** - This technology consists of a number of procedures. One of them is IP masking. This is one of the most prominent features of the coin that provides untraceable usage of the Apollo wallet. Another part of the Olympus protocol is the ability to provide both public and private transactions and the ability to choose the way their transaction will be performed.

    **Hermes Blockchain** - The Hermes blockchain has a number of properties which include 
        * Hermes provide transactions performance of nearly 2 seconds.
        * Hermes utilizes smart contracts
        * Coin staking
        * Cryptocurrency and token creation with Hermes network

    **Sharding** - The sharding technology allows the blockchain to be broken up into pieces across nodes and then accessed independently of one another. This solves one of the biggest issues that most every crytocurrency faces which is blockchain bloat. 

    **Atomic Swaps** - This technology ensures the execution of transactions between unrelated blockchains without the participation of intermediaries. The transaction is ensured under the condition that each party fulfills its part of the contract. 

    **DAG (in progress)** - This is a post-blockchain distributed ledger technology based on the advanced principles of DAG (directed acyclic graph) consensus. With an expected TPS (transactions per second) of at least one million. Directed acyclic graph functions as a network of interconnected branches that grow outward in several directions. Transactions can be confirmed faster, and in order of magnitude, while remaining decentralized, since each node confirms only the previous one.

# Results

* **What has been the business impact of this company so far?**

    With this being a new company they haven't had much impact on the consumer as of right now. They are still working on getting implemented by the governments to be used. But as of right now you can attain a Apollo wallet and buy and sell the coins. 

* **What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**

    Alot of it depends on the technology they are bringing to the table and what they are trying to solve and how effectviely they are doing so. Also a whitepaper showing a map of what the upcoming things they are trying to improve on and how they are getting better. I think Apollo is doing a very good job so far. They have a very good whitepaper that maps out all of 2020 so far. They bring alot of new technologies and big ideas that could really have a big impact with countries currencies. Also the CEO is very active on social platforms like twitter and constantly updating the community with new information and answering any questions. 

* **How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**

    Comparing other crytocurrencies to Apollo, I think Apollo is off to a good start being new and what they are trying to accomplish. They are trying to do something that nobody else has done and is almost doing something that is "to good to be true".

# Recommendations

* **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?**

    The use of a debit card.

* **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**

    I think it would be a good option to mobile. Alot of people are very use to using debit/credit cards and it would be a easy transition to it. Also you are not just relying on a phone to do transactions and in case of a emergency that your phone isnt working you have the card as a backup. 

* **What technologies would this additional product or serivce utilize?**

    Same technology that the Bitcoin card and Coinbase cards use which is peer-to-peer technology and blockchain. 

* **Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**

    It will be the same concept that they are using but to implement that with Apollo for mass adoption.
